# quick.css

**Quick** is a CSS framework for web developers, [like myself](https://www.guglielmopepe.com/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=quick.css), who do not have time to styling but want their web services to look nice. Current `master` points to version 2.1.1 of the framework. 

Check out on the [demo page](https://guglielmopepe.github.io/quick/examples.html).



## Goals

* Mobile first
* Good browser support
* Small size
* Visually pleasing
* No classes



## Why another css framework?

When i make demo applications or websites with simple content, i do not have time to styling them, but i don't like the default styles.

**Quick** allows me to focus on functionalities from the first day of a project. All CSS styles are applied to standard HTML elements.

This framework doesn't require any classes. I just include it in my ```<head>``` section and forget about it, while it silently makes everything nicer. In **Quick.css**, HTML is king while CSS is a supportive element that only makes HTML look better.

Unlike many other CSS frameworks, in **Quick.css** you donâ€™t have to mention CSS classes in the HTML document. The HTML stays clean and only exposes the data in a pure HTML5 way.



## Who could use it?

**Quick** is designed for people which are making a simple page or demo application when they do not have time to styling. 

It solves most of the problems associated with responsiveness of forms, appearance of form controls, tables, fonts, and colors.

When your demo is complete, you can spend time to styling. **Quick.css** gives you an adequate foundation to start from, but if you love simple beautiful page, you have finished.
