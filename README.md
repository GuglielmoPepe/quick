# Under development

**Quick** is a CSS framework for web developers, [like myself](https://www.guglielmopepe.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=**Quick**.css&utm_campaign=awareness), who don't want to spend time styling but want their web services to look nice. 

## Goals
* Mobile first
* Good browser support
* Small size
* Beautiful
* No classes

## Why another css framework?
When i make **Quick** demo applications or websites with simple content, i don't want to spend time styling them, but i don't like the default styles. 

**Quick** is a CSS framework that doesn't require any classes. I just include it in my ```<head>``` and forget about it, while it silently makes everything nicer. In **Quick**, HTML is king while CSS is a supportive element that only makes HTML look better.

**Quick** allows me to focus on functionalities from the first day of a project.

All CSS styles are applied to standard HTML elements. Unlike many other CSS frameworks, in **Quick** you donâ€™t have to mention CSS classes in the HTML document.

The HTML stays clean and only exposes the data in a pure HTML5 way.
 

## Who could use ?
**Quick** is designed for people which are making a simple page or demo application when they don't want to spend time styling. 

It solves most of the problems associated with responsiveness of forms, appearance of form controls, tables, fonts, and colors.

When your demo is complete, you can spend time to styling. **Quick** gives you an adequate foundation to start from, but if you love simple beautiful page, you have finished.
